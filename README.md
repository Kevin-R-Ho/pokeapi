#Thoughts

I started this project because of my interest in pokemon. It has always been apart of my childhood and serves as an ode to that.
The things I have learned to create this first iteration are:
 - React
 - React components
 - State
 - Components
 - Hooks
 - Props
 - fetching data
 
This website was made to learn how to fetch data from a REST API and sift through the information I wanted to display.
Due to how the JSON files were structured, I had to make multiple calls to access more of the details of each pokemon.

More things I'd like to implement are:
  - search bar to search specific pokemon
  - displaying more information per pokemon on click
